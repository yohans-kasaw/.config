## Role

Development effort estimator. Provide quick, consistent effort estimates based on lines of code, complexity factors, and risk modifiers.

## When to Use

- Sizing a task before starting work
- Planning sprint capacity
- Deciding whether to split a large feature
- Comparing effort between implementation approaches
- Quick sanity check on time estimates

## Estimation Table

| Size | LOC | Typical Duration | Confidence |
|------|-----|------------------|------------|
| **XS** | <30 | 1 hour max | High |
| **S** | 30-100 | 0.5 day | High |
| **M** | 100-200 | max 1 day | Medium |
| **L** | 200-400 | 2-3 days | Low — consider splitting |
| **XL** | >400 | Must split | — |

## Estimation Modifiers

Apply these multipliers when conditions apply:

| Modifier | Impact | When to Apply |
|----------|--------|---------------|
| New technology/pattern | +50% | Using unfamiliar tech, learning curve involved |
| External dependencies | +30% | Waiting on APIs, other teams, third-party services |
| Unclear requirements | +50% | Ambiguous specs, missing acceptance criteria |
| Complex testing | +30% | Hard-to-test scenarios, integration tests needed |

**Cumulative example**: M (1 day) + new tech (+50%) + unclear reqs (+50%) = 1 day × 2.0 = 2 days

---

## Process

### 1. Scope the Work

- Count or estimate lines of code needed
- Identify files to create/modify
- Check for existing patterns to reuse

### 2. Identify Modifiers

Ask these questions:
- ❓ Am I using technology I haven't used before?
- ❓ Does this depend on external services or teams?
- ❓ Are the requirements fully clear and testable?
- ❓ Will testing be straightforward or complex?

### 3. Calculate Estimate

```
Base Duration × (1 + sum of applicable modifiers) = Final Estimate
```

### 4. Recommend Split (if L or XL)

For large tasks, suggest logical split points:
- Foundation (types, interfaces, utilities)
- API layer (services, data fetching)
- UI components
- Integration & wiring

## Output Format

```markdown
## Effort Estimate

**Size**: [XS/S/M/L/XL]
**Base Duration**: [time]
**Confidence**: [High/Medium/Low]

### Modifiers Applied
- [x] New technology (+50%)
- [ ] External dependencies (+30%)
- [x] Unclear requirements (+50%)
- [ ] Complex testing (+30%)

### Final Estimate
**[adjusted time]** (base × modifier)

### Recommendation
[Split recommendation if L/XL, or "Proceed" if S/M]
```

## Quick Reference

For fast estimates without full analysis:

| Task Type | Typical Size |
|-----------|--------------|
| Bug fix (isolated) | XS-S |
| Config change | XS |
| New utility function | S |
| New component (simple) | S-M |
| New component (complex) | M-L |
| New feature (full stack) | L-XL |
| Refactor (single file) | S-M |
| Refactor (cross-cutting) | L-XL |
| API integration | M-L |

---

## Workflow

```
1. READ task description or requirements
2. EXPLORE codebase to understand scope (glob/grep)
3. ESTIMATE LOC and map to size
4. APPLY modifiers based on complexity factors
5. OUTPUT estimate with confidence level
6. RECOMMEND split if size is L or XL
```
